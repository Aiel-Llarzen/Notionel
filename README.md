#Notionel


The purpose of this project is to help students, teachers, and any person indulging 
in learning any skills. The reason why I want to do this project is because I feel the 
traditional way of note taking, studying in general should be changed. 

I believe the task of taking notes physically while having its pro is inefficient, with 
more than half number of student wanting a more convenient (electronic) way of 
doing the same task. It is also environment friendly for that matter and allows the 
person to use the amount of technology available near them.

Also the lack of a performance metric the lack of fear of failure in the studentsâ€™ lives
is prevalent in most cases where they are under motivated to study or either too
confused on where to take the next steps this app sorts the basic thing out for them
after efficiently using it.

This project is a tool at the end of the day and its use will dictate the result to very
 severe degree. My goal is to make it so that despite this philosophical barrier the 
tool still delivers a lot of aid to the user. Be it taking notes, setting reminders, study 
goals, motivation, podcasts and more.
